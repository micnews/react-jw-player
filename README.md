`<ReactJWPlayer>` is a React Component for initializing client-side instances of JW Player. Simply give `<ReactJWPlayer>` the id of your player script, and the id of a JW Player video or playlist. The component comes with several event hooks that can be accessed through component props.

## Installation

```shell
npm install react-jw-player
```

## Usage

At the mininum, you can just use something like the three following code snippets:

### Playing a JW Player JSON Playlist
``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ReactJWPlayer from 'react-jw-player';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactJWPlayer
    playerId='my-unique-id'
    playerScript='https://link-to-my-jw-player/script.js'
    playlist='https://link-to-my-playlist.json'
  />,
  document.getElementById('my-root-div');
);
```

### Playing a custom Playlist
``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ReactJWPlayer from 'react-jw-player';

const playlist = [{
  file: 'https://link-to-my-video.mp4',
  image: 'https://link-to-my-poster.jpg',
  tracks: [{
    file: 'https://link-to-subtitles.vtt',
    label: 'English',
    kind: 'captions',
    'default': true
  }],
},
{
  file: 'https://link-to-my-other-video.mp4',
  image: 'https://link-to-my-other-poster.jpg',
}];

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactJWPlayer
    playerId='my-unique-id'
    playerScript='https://link-to-my-jw-player/script.js'
    playlist={playlist}
  />,
  document.getElementById('my-root-div');
);
```

### Playing a Specific File
``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ReactJWPlayer from 'react-jw-player';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ReactJWPlayer
    playerId='my-unique-id'
    playerScript='https://link-to-my-jw-player/script.js'
    file='https://link-to-my-video.mp4'
  />,
  document.getElementById('my-root-div');
);
```

For more complex interaction, check out the container component example [here](#example-container-component)

To generate preroll, supply the player with the `generatePrerollUrl` prop. This prop just needs to be a function that returns a valid VAST tag! See (Optional Configuration Props)[#optional-configuration-props] for more info.

## Required Props

These are props that modify the basic behavior of the component.
* `playerId`
  * A unique Id for the player instance. Used to distinguish the container divs.
  * Type: `string`
  * Example: `playerId="my-jw-player-instance"`
* `playerScript`
  * Link to a valid JW Player script.
  * Type: `string`
  * Example: `https://content.jwplatform.com/libraries/abCD1234.js`
* `playlist` OR `file`
  * Link to a valid JW Player playlist or video file, or playlist array. Cool tip: JW Player automatically generates JSON feeds for individual videos if you use the video id in place of `abCD1234`. You can use this to get meta data on the videos without loading an actual playlist.
  * Type: `string` (for `file` and `playlist`) or `array` (for `playlist`)
  * Example: `https//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/abCD1234.json`

## Optional Configuration Props

  * Type: `string`
* `customProps`
  * An optional object containing properties to be applied directly to the JW Player instance. Add anything in the API, like skins, into this object. `customProps={{ skin: { name: 'six' } }}`.

  * Determines whether the player starts automatically or not.
  * Type: `boolean`
* `isMuted`
  * Determines whether the player starts muted or not.

## Example Container Component
``` javascript
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

import ReactJWPlayer from 'react-jw-player';

const displayName = 'ReactJWPlayerContainer';

const propTypes = {
  playlist: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  playerScript: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

class ReactJWPlayerContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      videoTitle: '',
    };

    this.onAdPlay = this.onAdPlay.bind(this);
    this.onVideoLoad = this.onVideoLoad.bind(this);

    // each instance of <ReactJWPlayer> needs a unique id.
    // we randomly generate it here and assign to the container instance.
    this.playerId = someFunctionToRandomlyGenerateId();
  }
  onAdPlay(event) {
    // track the ad play here
  }
  onVideoLoad(event) {
    this.setState({
      videoTitle: event.item.description // this only works with json feeds!
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className='react-jw-player-container'>
        <h1>{ this.state.videoTitle }</h1>
        <ReactJWPlayer
          playlist={this.props.playlist}
          licenseKey='your-license-key'
          onAdPlay={this.onAdPlay}
          onVideoLoad={this.onVideoLoad}
          playerId={this.playerId} // bring in the randomly generated playerId
          playerScript='https://link-to-your-jw-player-script.js'
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactJWPlayerContainer.propTypes = propTypes;
ReactJWPlayerContainer.defaultProps = defaultProps;
ReactJWPlayerContainer.displayName = displayName;
export default ReactJWPlayerContainer;
```
